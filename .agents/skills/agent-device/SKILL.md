# agent-device

Router only. Private setup before using this skill:

```bash
agent-device --version
```

If that fails but the user may have installed `agent-device` globally, check the user's configured login/interactive shell and environment before using `npx`. Resolve the command the same way the user would from a normal terminal session, then run the absolute binary path if found. This may require inspecting shell startup behavior or package-manager/global bin locations; do not assume the Codex process `PATH` is the user's `PATH`.

Require `agent-device >= 0.14.0`; older CLIs lack these help topics. If older, stop and tell the user to upgrade the trusted install or approve an exact-version npm command. Do not run `npm install -g agent-device@latest` or `npx -y agent-device@latest` autonomously, and do not include version/upgrade commands in final plans.

Before your first agent-device command or plan, read the version-matched CLI guide:

```bash
agent-device help workflow
```

Escalate only when relevant:

```bash
agent-device help debugging
agent-device help react-native
agent-device help react-devtools
agent-device help remote
agent-device help macos
agent-device help dogfood
```

Default loop: `open -> snapshot/-i -> get/is/find or press/fill/scroll/wait -> verify -> close`.

Use this skill only to route into version-matched CLI help. Let `help workflow` provide exact command shapes, platform limits, and current workflow guidance.

For precise location workflows, read the installed `settings` help before planning so coordinate support and platform limits come from the active CLI version.
